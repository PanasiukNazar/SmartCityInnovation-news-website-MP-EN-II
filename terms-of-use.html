                        to the website at our sole discretion, without notice,

                        termination, your right to use the website will
                        immediately cease.

                        If any provision of these Terms is found to be

                        or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that
                        the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in
                        full force and effect.
